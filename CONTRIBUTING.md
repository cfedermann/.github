## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead [contact me via email](mailto:cfedermann@gmail.com).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under "Issues" for the respective project.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request (PR) with the patch. This should include tests.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read any "Code style and conventions" guides in the corresponding repository to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change on GitHub under "Issues", opening a "Feature request".

* Do not start writing code until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

#### **Most importantly:**

The magic of open source is made possible by volunteers, such as yourself, who contribute to projects.
